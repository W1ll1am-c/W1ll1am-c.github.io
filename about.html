            </h2>
            <h3>Student</h3>
            <p>I am William Chen, a highschooler. My interests lies in the tech
                field, stemming from my interest in technology, specifically computers, and video games.</p>

            <p> My journey started on a spiderman game on my dad's beige box. The motion of spiderman fascinating my 5
                year old
                self. From then on, I knew my path was going to involve improving such technology. At 11 years old, I
                got my
                first personal computer. It was an all in one Lenovo desktop. I had my first beginner coding lessons, my
                first
                online games, and my first exploration of the vast world of technology. At 14, I built my first PC. The
                research
                required before I selected the PC parts improved my knowledge of PC parts. It was also the first time
                I've spent
                a huge chunk of time doing research and enjoying education. That convinced me to join my schools IT
                career tech
                program. It showed me the possibilities of the future in tech and expanded the horizon of my possible
                future. I
                learned coding languages like javascript, css, html, and a little bit of C. My internship during the
                summer of
                2024 at Wright Brothers Institute gave me valuable experience in the workplace and the hardware aspect
                of
                technology. With my ambition and work ethic, I was able to win the FlexFactor innovation competition
                with
                NextFlex With the advancement of technology, my hunger for knowledge grows with it as more opportunity
                arises.

            <p>
                Video games are one of my many hobbies. For as long as I can remember.
                From
                single-players to online games, I do not discriminate. I spend most of my gaming time on competitive
                first
                person shooters like Valorant and CSGO. Pickleball is another one of my hobbies. Ever since I've started
                playing,
                I feel in love with the sport. I would spend my weekends at the pickleball courts with my friends.
                Cooking is
                another passion of mine. Growing up in a restaurant introduced me to cooking. I was able to make dishes
                since I
                was 12. Cooking came with me as I left the restaurant as I enjoy making dishes at home from time to
                time.
                Self-improvement is another interest of mine. I regularly workout and choose healthier contact options.
